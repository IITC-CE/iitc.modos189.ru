                    <p><strong>Ingress Intel Total Conversion (IITC)</strong> is an add-on that works as an overlay for the official <a href="https://ingress.com" target="_blank">Ingress</a> <a href="https://intel.ingress.com" target="_blank">intel map</a>.
                        IITC completely changes the way you work with the map, significantly increases efficiency by applying hardware acceleration and expands the capabilities via the use of various plugins.</p>
                    <p>IITC has long become the basis of numerous tools for both factions, as it serves as a platform for different applications and plugins.
                        Besides several confidential plugins, which help coordinate operations for a team of agents, there are also public ones, available to both factions.</p>
                    <p><a href="https://github.com/breunigs" target="_blank">Stefan Breunig</a> was the main driving force.</p>
                    <p><strong>IITC "Community Edition" (IITC-CE)</strong> started by <a href="https://github.com/modos189" target="_blank">modos189</a> to continue development of stalled <a href="https://github.com/iitc-project/ingress-intel-total-conversion" target="_blank">iitc-project</a>.
